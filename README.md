**Description:**
  
  The project has two parts including Top10.ipynb and Parking.ipynb. The aim of this project is to analyze what the top 10 causes of calls to 311 are in 10027, and  how many total incidents of each of these 10 types there have been in the year 2020. Besides, we analyze whether illegal parking incidents are a larger fraction of total 311 incidents in 10027 than they are in general. We then compute the fraction and find whether the fraction is greater than or smaller than the total fraction of parking incidents across all ZIP codes.
  
  We mainly use "Complaint Type" and "Incident Zip" from "311_Service_Requests_2020.csv".
