**Description:**
  
  The project has two parts including Top10.ipynb and Parking.ipynb. The aim of this project is to analyze what the top 10 causes of calls to 311 are in 10027, and  how many total incidents of each of these 10 types there have been in the year 2020. Besides, we analyze whether illegal parking incidents are a larger fraction of total 311 incidents in 10027 than they are in general. We then compute the fraction and find whether the fraction is greater than or smaller than the total fraction of parking incidents across all ZIP codes.
  
  We mainly use "Complaint Type" and "Incident Zip" from "311_Service_Requests_2020.csv".
  
**Top10.ipynb:**

We firstly filter out data with a zipcode of 10027. Then we counted the number of times its top 10 complaints types occured. Then we counted the whole dataset and find corresponding data associated with top 10 complaints types. We find that the top 10 complaints types in 10027 is nearly the same as what in all areas.

**Parking.ipynb:**

We want to see how parking violations in our zipcode compare to the total amount of all incidents. Using pandas, we are able to pull out the data for each respective attrribute, moreover we are now able to find the corresponding ratios to compare; moreover allowing us to claim that our zipcode has a lower proportion of parking violations compared to the overall ratio
